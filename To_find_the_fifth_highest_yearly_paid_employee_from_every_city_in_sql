# Structure of the table
create table employee_details(
employee_id int,
month_year date,
salary float,
city varchar2(250)
)

#Input data format
insert into employee_details1 values(1,to_date('01-2019','MM-YYYY'),9800,'Bangalore');

#Approach
Step#1: Since we have to find the fifth highest salary for every year based on city and the format of year is given as MONTH_YEAR.
So, initially we will split column MONTH_YEAR as MONTH and YEAR.

This can be achieved by using subquery:

SELECT employee_id, 
      salary, 
      substr(month_year, 4, 3) AS Month1,
      substr(month_year, 8, 4) AS Year1, 
      city 
      FROM employee_details1
)P

Step#2: Now we have to find the yearly salary of each employee group by city. The above query can be modified as below to get the
salary of each employee on yearly basis.

SELECT P.employee_id,
     sum(P.salary) as ctc, 
     P.Year1,
     P.city 
     FROM (SELECT employee_id, 
                  salary, 
                  substr(month_year, 4, 3) AS Month1,
                  substr(month_year, 8, 4) AS Year1, 
                  city 
                  FROM employee_details1
            )P
GROUP BY P.Year1, P.employee_id, P.city


Step#3: Now to find the fifth highest salary, we can use the DENSE_RANK() function to rank each row based on salary. 
And to find the fifth higest salary we can filter by passing D_RANK() as 5. If you need 3rd highest salary we can filter 
by passing D_RANK() as 3

So, below is the full code to find the fifth highest yearly paid employee from every city:

SELECT * FROM 
(SELECT employee_id,
        city,
        ctc,
        year1, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY ctc DESC) AS D_RANK 
        FROM (SELECT P.employee_id,
                     sum(P.salary) as ctc, 
                     P.Year1,
                     P.city 
                     FROM (SELECT employee_id, 
                                  salary, 
                                  substr(month_year, 4, 3) AS Month1,
                                  substr(month_year, 8, 4) AS Year1, 
                                  city 
                                  FROM employee_details1
                            )P
                GROUP BY P.Year1, P.employee_id, P.city
                )Q
) WHERE D_RANK=5
